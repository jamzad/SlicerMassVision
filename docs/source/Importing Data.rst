Loading an Existing Project
-----------
If have a saved project you would like to resume working on, click 'Load an existing project..' at the top of the tab. Note that saved projects include annotated scenes, labeled segments, ion visulizations, however, they do not save the DESI file that was used in the previous processing (since the file is too large to store with the proect). After loading a saved project, load the DESI file to continue editing where you left off. 



To clear the scene, navigate to the 'Clear data and start a new project' button at the top of the Data Import Tab.
