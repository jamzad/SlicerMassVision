Projects
--------
To clear any open data and analysis in MassVision, click on **Clear data and analysis** button in Project section. We recommend that users clear MassVision before uploading any new MSI data, or starting a new independent task. 

If you have a saved MassVision project that you would like to resume working on, click **Load project** button.

.. important::
   After loading a saved MassVision project, you must reload the corresponding MSI data to resume editing from where you left off.

MassVision projects contain all processed files, such as annotated scenes, labeled segments, and visualizations. However, the original MSI data used in the analysis is excluded to prevent project size inflation and avoid duplicating the original data.

Quick Access
------------
MassVision is organized into multiple tabs, each containing specific functionalities to help you efficiently manage and navigate the system. The **Quick access** section provides convenient access to all tabs within MassVision. The available modules include:

* Data Import/Export – Importing and exporting MSI and pathology data
